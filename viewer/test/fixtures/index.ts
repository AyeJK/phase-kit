/**
 * Absolute paths to every test fixture, so tests never build `../` paths by hand.
 *
 * Each project fixture is a project folder: `{root}/docs/phases/Phase-N-*.md`,
 * so `loadProject(root)` can point straight at it. Fixtures are copies checked
 * in here; no test reads the plugin's `examples/` folder.
 *
 * | Fixture          | What it covers |
 * |------------------|----------------|
 * | `sample-project` | Verbatim copy of the plugin's `examples/sample-project/docs/` (phases + design). 1 phase, 2 sprints, 7 tasks, all `x`, 0 warnings expected. Has `docs/design/design-system.md`. |
 * | `multi-phase`    | 3 phases, 7 sprints. Cross-sprint and cross-phase dependencies, all seven canonical statuses (3.2's task 3 is `MANUAL`), sprint 2.2 has no Verification block, sprint 3.1 has an unknown `### Notes` section, sprint 2.3 has two `ui` routes and an unknown `timeout` key, sprint 2.1 has two `assert` bullets. Phase 1 ends with `## Scope Guard`; phase 2 ends with `## Scope Guard` and `## Risk Mitigations`. No design system. Run logs in `docs/phases/.runs/`, see {@link MULTI_PHASE_RUN_LOGS}. |
 * | `legacy-table`   | Sprint 1.1 table has no Status column (3 legacy tasks, 5/4/3-cell rows); sprint 1.2 is the migrated shape. Sprint 1.1 has no Verification block. |
 * | `sparse-rows`    | Sprint 1.1: 5-column header with 5-, 4- and 3-cell rows. Task 2 is a 4-cell Module-only row (`src/api/retry.ts`); task 4 is the 4-cell Reference-only form (`docs/design/screens/settings.md`, which a parser can only tell apart by its `docs/` / `.md` shape); task 5 has a `—` placeholder Module. Sprint 1.2: a 4-column `Status \| # \| Task \| Reference` header. |
 * | `mixed-symbols`  | Status cells `[x]`, `[X]`, `[ ]`, `-`, `–`, `—`, `X`, `blocked`, `Cut`, `deferred`, and `WIP` (→ `unknown`). Headers with en dash (phase + 1.1), colon (1.2) and hyphen (1.3). Checkbox and `*` acceptance bullets. Mixed-case Verification keys in 1.2 (`CLI:`, `Skip-UI: TRUE`). |
 * | `broken`         | See {@link BROKEN_LINES}. Contains real NUL and invalid UTF-8 bytes; `.gitattributes` marks it binary. |
 * | `trail-log`      | The dev / e2e fixture that `scripts/simulate-run.ts` plays a live run on. 3 phases, 8 sprints, run logs for phases 1 and 2. See {@link TRAIL_LOG}. |
 *
 * {@link RUN_LOGS} holds standalone `.jsonl` run logs: two real ones
 * (`realSmoke`, `realPhase1`) and synthetic ones for each shape the reader and
 * wave derivation must handle. Lines are LF-terminated unless noted.
