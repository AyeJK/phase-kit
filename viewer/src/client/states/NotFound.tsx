/**
 * Not found (design-system.md "Not found", "Unified states"): an unknown
 * phase (in the slide-in panel or the list view's rail) or any other address
 * (under the filter row) shows a message in the `.empty` block with a link
 * back to the phases (`/`). The shell stays around it.
 *
 * An unknown sprint never gets here on its own: `/sprint/:id` redirects to
 * its phase's panel, so an unknown sprint of an unknown phase shows that
 * phase as not found.
 *
 * Test hooks: `[data-testid=not-found]` with `data-kind` (`phase` or
 * `page`), `not-found-overview` (the link).
