/**
 * The phase-viewer core model.
 *
 * One typed snapshot of a project folder: its phase plans (phases → sprints →
 * tasks) plus the run-log events phase-builder's gates appended while running
 * them, grouped into waves with derived escalations and progress.
 *
 * Three layers fill it:
 *
 * - The phase-file parser fills {@link Phase}, {@link Sprint}, {@link Task} and
 *   everything under them. It never throws; anything it can't read becomes a
 *   {@link Warning}.
 * - The run-log reader fills {@link RunEvent}. It skips malformed lines, also
 *   with a warning.
 * - `loadProject` (`load.ts`) ties both together and derives {@link PhaseRuns},
 *   {@link WaveRun}, {@link SprintRun}, {@link Escalation} (`derive/run.ts`)
 *   and {@link ProjectProgress} (`derive/progress.ts`). `sprintHistory`
 *   (`derive/history.ts`) answers the Sprint detail page's run questions.
 *
 * Everything here is plain JSON data (no Maps, Sets, Dates or classes) so the
 * server can send a {@link Project} over SSE unchanged.
 *
 * Line numbers are always 1-based. Paths in {@link Task.module} are relative to
 * the app root; paths in {@link Task.reference} are relative to the project
 * folder. Both are kept exactly as written in the phase file.

 * `–`, `[ ]`, `[x]`, lowercase words). Anything else normalizes to `unknown`
 * and the raw text is kept in {@link Task.rawStatus}.
 *

 * | `implement` (any other result)      | `verifying`: phase-verify logs `implement` as it starts, so its `ts` marks when verifying began |
 * | `verify` fail                       | `failed` |
 * | `verify` not fail, UI wave          | `testing`: the wave runs a wave test (a sprint in it has a browser test, or a `wave_test` line was already seen in the wave) |

 *   without start lines only yield this for a sprint whose every event has an
 *   unknown gate. Consumers may use it for a sprint they know is in the

 * - `failed`: a gate failed and nothing later was logged for the sprint. That
 *   covers a retry in progress, a run the user stopped, and an escalation
