/**
 * Run derivation: one phase's run-log events in, waves, per-sprint run state
 * and escalations out. Pure (data in, data out) and never throws on any event
 * list the reader can produce.
 *
 * Everything comes from **line order**; `ts` is only copied, never compared
 * (clocks skew, and parallel appends share a second).
 *
 * Runs and waves (spec: `run-log.md`, "Reading the log"):
 *
 * - Events are cut into waves wherever `wave` changes between consecutive
 *   lines. A drop in `wave` (e.g. 3 → 1) starts a new run, because
 *   phase-builder restarts wave numbers on every run of the phase; a rise
 *   (1 → 2) is the next wave of the same run. A run resumed inside the same
 *   wave number reads as a continuation of that wave.
 * - Within a wave, events are grouped by sprint in first-seen order.
 * - Wave start is the wave's first event. Wave end is reached once every
 *   sprint in the wave has a passing `doc_sync` as its latest event.
 * - `implement` `start` markers don't cut waves. The next wave's
 *   implementation starts while the previous wave's doc sync runs, so its
 *   start lines can land between that wave's lines. Each marker joins the wave
 *   with its wave number in the run it belongs to (the run of the wave before
 *   it in the log, or the next run when its wave number is lower), preferring
 *   one with lines after it; with none logged yet it opens that wave on its
 *   own. Markers are never gate steps and never attempts.
 * - `task` lines (an implementer's "task N started" / "task N finished") are
 *   markers too, and kept further out: they are in no wave's or sprint's
 *   `events`, so they are never gate steps, attempts, retries or escalations,
 *   never cut a wave, and never move a wave's or sprint's start, end or
 *   state. Each one is placed like a start marker, in the wave with its wave
 *   number in the run it belongs to, but never opens a wave: one with no such
 *   wave, or whose sprint has no event in it, is left out. What they say is
 *   {@link SprintRun.tasks}: per sprint and wave, the latest `task` line per
 *   task number (`start` is running, `pass` is built; any other result is
 *   ignored). A log without them derives exactly as before.
 *
 * Sprint state: see {@link SprintRunState} for the table. A wave "runs a wave
 * test" when any of its sprints is in {@link DeriveRunOptions.uiSprints}, or
 * when a `wave_test` line already appeared in the wave.
 *
 * Escalations: a sprint's latest event in a wave is a `verify` or `wave_test`
 * `fail` with `max > 0` and `attempt >= max`, and the sprint has no later
 * event anywhere in the log. `max: 0` never escalates. The escalation carries
 * every run of that gate for the sprint in the wave as its retry history.
